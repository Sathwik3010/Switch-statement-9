Switch case

if several options are available then It is not recommended to use if else. we should go for switch statement because it improves readability of the code.

syntax
---------
switch(ch){
case 1:
action-1;
break;
case 2:
action-2;
case 3:
action-3;
break;
;;;;;
case n:
action-n;
break;
default:
}

until 1.4 version the allow types for the switch argument are byte, short, int, char but from 1.5 version onwards corresponding wrapper classes(Byte, Short, int, Character)
